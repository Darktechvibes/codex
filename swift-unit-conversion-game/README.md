# Swift Unit Conversion Game

This example shows a simple SwiftUI view that replicates the functionality of the unit conversion web game.

The view generates random questions for converting between units like meters and centimeters. Children can type the answer, check it, and see statistics for correct and wrong answers. A button can fetch a fun fact about the units from the Gemini API.

To use, embed `UnitConversionGameView` inside a SwiftUI application. Provide your Gemini API key in `fetchFunFact()` where marked.
